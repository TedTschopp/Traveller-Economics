# Directory Reorganization Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Analysis Directory Migration

### What Was Done:
1. **Created Analysis Directory**: New dedicated directory for all analysis outputs
2. **Moved All Files**: Migrated all existing analysis outputs from `output/` to `Analysis/`
3. **Updated All Scripts**: Modified all Python scripts to use `Analysis/` as default output location
4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Scripts check both new and old locations for data files

### Files Moved to Analysis/:
- ✅ All CSV data files (25+ files including universal datasets)
- ✅ All text reports and summaries  
- ✅ All trade route analysis files
- ✅ All Trojan Reach specific analyses
- ✅ Visualizations directory
- ✅ Both general and ship-specific optimization results

### Scripts Updated:
- ✅ `traveller_economics.py` - Main economic analysis engine
- ✅ `all_factions_analysis.py` - Universal faction analyzer  
- ✅ `advanced_analysis.py` - Advanced economic indicators
- ✅ `universal_trade_circuit_optimizer.py` - Trade route optimizer
- ✅ `trojan_reach_trade_optimizer.py` - Trojan Reach specific analyzer
- ✅ `debug_trade_optimizer.py` - Debug utilities

### Benefits:
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of analysis outputs from scripts
- **Professional Structure**: Follows standard data science project layout
- **Improved Navigation**: All results in one dedicated location
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive README.md in Analysis directory
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old file paths still work during transition

### Current Analysis Directory Contents:
```
Analysis/
├── README.md                                 # Documentation
├── all_factions_worlds.csv                   # Complete universe dataset
├── all_imperium_worlds.csv                   # Third Imperium dataset  
├── faction_statistics.csv                    # Political faction stats
├── advanced_economic_indicators.csv          # Gini, diversity, development
├── trojan_reach_j2_c64_circuits.csv         # Your requested analysis
├── trojan_reach_j2_c64_circuit_legs.csv     # Detailed leg analysis
├── trojan_reach_j2_c64_analysis.md          # Complete strategy report
├── [and 20+ other analysis files]
└── visualizations/                           # Charts and graphs
```

### Future Analysis:
All new analysis will automatically be saved to the `Analysis/` directory by default. The system is now properly organized for ongoing economic research and trade route optimization.

### Test Confirmation:
✅ Trade circuit optimizer tested and confirmed working with new directory structure  
✅ New Trojan Reach J2/64-ton analysis generated successfully in Analysis directory  
✅ All file paths updated and functional
