TRAVELLER ATTRIBUTION:

This project uses data from the Traveller role-playing game universe.
Traveller is a trademark of Far Future Enterprises.
All Traveller material is used under Fair Use for analysis and research purposes.

The Traveller Map project (https://travellermap.com/) by Joshua Bell provides
the API and data sources used by this analysis toolkit. We are grateful for
this excellent resource made available to the Traveller community.

Sector data is contributed by the Traveller community and maintained by
various volunteers. This project would not be possible without their
dedication to preserving and organizing the vast Traveller universe.
